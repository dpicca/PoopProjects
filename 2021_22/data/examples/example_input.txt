<docDate><date>1919</date>To THE LORD CHARNWOOD NOTE In using for purposes of drama a personality of so wide and recent a fame as that of Abraham Lincoln , I feel that one or two observations are due to my readers and critics . First , my purpose is that not of the historian but of the dramatist . The historical presentation of my hero has been faithfully made in many volumes ; notably , in England , by Lord Charnwood in a monograph that gives a masterly analysis of Lincoln 's career and character and is , it seems to me , a model of what the historian 's work should be . To this book I am gratefully indebted for the material of my play . But while I have , I hope , done nothing to traverse history , I have freely telescoped its events , and imposed invention upon its movement , in such ways as I needed to shape the dramatic significance of my subject . I should add that the fictitious Burnet Hook is admitted to the historical company of Lincoln 's Cabinet for the purpose of embodying certain forces that were antagonistic to the President . This was a dramatic necessity , and I chose rather to invent a character for the purpose than to invest any single known personage with sinister qualities about which there might be dispute . Secondly , my purpose is , again , that of the dramatist , not that of the political philosopher . The issue of secession was a very intricate one , upon which high and generous opinions may be in conflict , but that I may happen to have or lack personal sympathy with Lincoln 's policy and judgment in this matter is nothing . My concern is with the profoundly dramatic interest of his character , and with the inspiring example of a man who handled war nobly and with imagination . Finally , I am an Englishman , and not a citizen of the great country that gave Lincoln birth . I have , therefore , written as an Englishman , making no attempt to achieve a “ local colour ” of which I have no experience , or to speak in an idiom to which I have not been bred . To have done otherwise , as I am sure any American friends that this play may have the good fortune to make will allow , would have been to treat a great subject with levity .</docDate>
<docImprint>J. D . Far Oakridge , July-August ,<date>1918</date>INTRODUCTORY NOTE This play was originally produced by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre last year , and it had a great success in Birmingham . But if its author had not happened to be the artistic director of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre the play might never have been produced there . The rumour of the provincial success reached<settlement>London</settlement>, with the usual result — that<settlement>London</settlement>managers magnificently ignored it . I have myself spoken with a very well-known<settlement>London</settlement>actor-manager who admitted to me that he had refused the play .</docImprint>

<performance>When Nigel Playfair , in conjunction with myself as a sort of Chancellor of the Exchequer , started the Hammersmith Playhouse ( for the presentation of the best plays that could be got ) we at once began to inquire into the case of Abraham Lincoln . Nigel Playfair was absolutely determined to have the play and the Birmingham company to act it . I read the play and greatly admired it . We secured both the play and the company . The first Hammersmith performance was a tremendous success , both for the author of the play and for William J. Rea , the Irish actor who in the rôle of Lincoln was merely great . The audience cried .</performance>
<titlePage>
<docTitle><titlePart>I should have cried myself , but for my iron resolve not to stain a well-earned reputation for callousness . As I returned home that night from what are known as “ the wilds of Hammersmith ” ( Hammersmith is a suburb of London ) I said to myself : “ This play is bound to succeed ” The next moment I said to myself : “ This play cannot possibly succeed . It has no love interest . It is a political play . Its theme is the threatened separation of the Southern States from the Northern States . Nobody ever heard of a play with such an absurd theme reaching permanent success . No author before John Drinkwater ever had the effrontery to impose such a theme on a London public . ” My instinct was right and my reason was wrong . The play did succeed . It is still succeeding , and it will continue to succeed . Nobody can dine out in London to-day and admit without a blush that he has not seen ABRAHAM LINCOLN . Monarchs and princes have seen it . Archbishops have seen it . Statesmen without number have seen it . An ex-Lord Chancellor told me that he had journeyed out into the said wilds and was informed at the theatre that there were no seats left . He could not believe that he would have to return from the wilds unsatisfied . But so it fell out . West End managers have tried to coax the play from Hammersmith to the West End . They could not do it . We have contrived to make all London come to Hammersmith to see a play without a love-interest or a bedroom scene , and the play will remain at Hammersmith . Americans will more clearly realize what John Drinkwater has achieved with the London public if they imagine somebody putting on a play about the Crimean War at some unknown derelict theatre round about Two Hundred and Fiftieth Street , and drawing all New York to Two Hundred and Fiftieth Street . ABRAHAM LINCOLN has pleased everybody , and its triumph is the best justification of those few who held that the public was capable of liking much better plays than were offered to the public . Why has ABRAHAM LINCOLN succeeded ? Here are a few answers to the question : Because the author had a deep , practical knowledge of the stage . Because he disdained all stage tricks . Because he had the wit to select for his hero one of the world 's greatest and finest characters . Because he had the audacity to select a gigantic theme and to handle it with simplicity . Because he had the courage of all his artistic and moral convictions . And of course because he has a genuine dramatic gift . Finally , because William J. Rea plays Lincoln with the utmost nobility of emotional power . Every audience has the same experience at ABRAHAM LINCOLN , and I laugh privately when I think of that experience . The curtain goes up on a highly commonplace little parlour , and a few ordinary people chatting in a highly commonplace manner . They keep on chatting . The audience thinks to itself : “ I 've been done ! What is this interminable small talk ? ” And it wants to call out a protest : “ Hi ! You fellows on the stage ! Have you forgotten that there is an audience on the other side of the footlights , waiting for something to happen ? ” ( Truly the ordinary people in the parlour do seem to be unaware of the existence of any audience . ) But wait , audience ! Already the author is winding his chains about you . Though you may not suspect it , you are already bound .... At the end of the first scene the audience , vaguely feeling the spell , wonders what on earth the nature of the spell is . At the end of the play it is perhaps still wondering what precisely the nature of the spell is .... But it fully and rapturously admits the reality of the spell . Indeed after the fall of the curtain , and after many falls of the curtain , the spell persists ; the audience somehow cannot leave its seats , and the thought of the worry of the journey home and of last ‘ busses and trains is banished . Strange phenomenon ! It occurs every night .</titlePart></docTitle>

<stage>Two Chroniclers :</stage>
<stage>The two speaking together : Kinsmen , you shall behold Our stage , in mimic action , mould A man 's character .</stage>
<stage>This is the wonder , always , everywhere — Not that vast mutability which is event , The pits and pinnacles of change , But man 's desire and valiance that range All circumstance , and come to port unspent .</stage>
<stage>Agents are these events , these ecstasies , And tribulations , to prove the purities Or poor oblivions that are our being . When Beauty and peace possess us , they are none But as they touch the beauty and peace of men , Nor , when our days are done , And the last utterance of doom must fall , Is the doom anything Memorable for its apparelling ; The bearing of man facing it is all .</stage>
<stage>So , kinsmen , we present This for no loud event That is but fugitive , But that you may behold Our mimic action mould The spirit of man immortally to live .</stage>
<stage>First Chronicler : Once when a peril touched the days Of freedom in our English ways , And none renowned in government Was equal found , Came to the steadfast heart of one , Who watched in lonely Huntingdon , A summons , and he went , And tyranny was bound , And Cromwell was the lord of his event .</stage>
<stage>Second Chronicler : And in that land where voyaging The pilgrim Mayflower came to rest , Among the chosen , counselling , Once , when bewilderment possessed A people , none there was might draw To fold the wandering thoughts of men , And make as one the names again Of liberty and law .</stage>
<stage>And then , from fifty fameless years In quiet Illinois was sent A word that still the Atlantic hears , And Lincoln was the lord of his event .</stage>
<stage>The two speaking together : So the uncounted spirit wakes To the birth Of uncounted circumstance . And time in a generation makes Portents majestic a little story of earth To be remembered by chance At a fireside . But the ardours that they bear , The proud and invincible motions of character —</stage>
<stage>These — these abide .</stage>
